The gui.py uses easygui to create a simpler method of use for non-technical users.

1. Create codebooks (if you are the cryptokey issuer)
    Select "Generate codebooks"
    Select which codes to generate (usually All)
    Select which format to generate
        NOTE: You should pick ONE method of using this system:

        A. Pen and Paper, using printed PDF or TXT format sheets that you physically cut out codes from once they are used.

        B. Airgapped computer using the ECCS GUI and Pickle files.
        Doing both and having multiple copies of codebooks would create the danger that the codes are not securely cleared from 
        all of them immediately once used. Multiple parties do not have to use the same method as messages encrypted on a computer 
        can be decrypted by hand, and vice versa, obviously excluding AES messages, but a single party should not mix them.
    Generated codepads will be in the "codebooks folder" with names such as "2022-05-12_288394_auth.pickle"
    The filename is obviously the date created, but also the key ID.

2. Select codebooks to use
    Select "Select codebooks"
    Enter the date and key ID that is in the filename, for example: 2022-05-12_288394_auth.pickle
    Date: 2022-05-12
    ID: 288394
    ECCS-GUI will now use those codes

3. Menu options
    AES Encrypt

    AES Decrypt

    AES File Encrypt

    AES File Decrypt

    Authentify

    Select codebooks: see above

    Generate codebooks: see above

    Securely wipe file

    DESTROY CODEBOOKS
        Using shredcodes.sh this will securely wipe all codebooks, you will be asked for confirmation first. The script can also be run stand-alone.

    TEST MODE TOGGLE
        This is an UNSECURE debug mode which allows the re-use of codes, they will not be deleted from the files. Do not use this in a live environment. Controlled by "args_keeppad = True" in the code.

    Exit
