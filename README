ENCRYPTED COVERT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION
    ECCS is a simple python-based encryption/decryption system made to easily be able to send short 
    symmetric-key encrypted messages over whatever method is necessary. The system is made to be able 
    to be used both manually using printed documents (except the AES and RSA methods which requires 
    some form of computer) as well as electronically. It is intended as a complete and secure SHTF 
    communication system.

UTILITIES
    - Codebook generation scripts for txt, pdf and pickle formats
    - AES message cryptography
    - AES file cryptography
    - One Time Pad cryptography
    - Brevity codes for OTP
    - Authentification method
    - RSA key generation
    - RSA-AES message cryptography
    - RSA-AES file cryptography
    - XOR One time pad file cryptography
    - Steghide interface

WARNING
    ALWAYS use an airgapped, secure and encrypted computer to generate, store and interact with code 
    books and keys.

    NOTE: You should pick ONE method of using this system per operator:

    A. Pen and Paper, using printed PDF or TXT format sheets that you physically cut out and destroy 
    codes from once they are used.

    B. Airgapped and disk-encrypted computer using the ECCS utilities and Pickle files.

    Doing both and having multiple copies of codebooks would create the danger that the codes are not 
    securely cleared from all of them immediately once used. Multiple parties do not have to use the 
    same method as messages encrypted on a computer can be decrypted by hand, and vice versa, obviously 
    excluding AES and RSA messages, but a single party should not mix them.

CHANGELOG:
    1.0: python 2.7
    1.1: EasyGUI frontend
    1.2: RSA-AES encryption and steghide interface
