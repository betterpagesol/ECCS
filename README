ENCRYPTED COVERT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION
    ECCS is a simple python-based encryption/decryption system made to easily be able to send short symmetric-key encrypted
    messages over whatever method is necessary. The system is made to be able to be used both manually using printed 
    documents (except the AES crypter which requires some form of computer) as well as electronically.

    ALWAYS use an airgapped, secure and encrypted computer to generate, store and interact with code books and keys.

    NOTE: You should pick ONE method of using this system:

    A. Pen and Paper, using printed PDF or TXT format sheets that you physically cut out codes from once they are used.

    B. Airgapped computer using the ECCS GUI and Pickle files.
    Doing both and having multiple copies of codebooks would create the danger that the codes are not securely cleared from 
    all of them immediately once used. Multiple parties do not have to use the same method as messages encrypted on a computer 
    can be decrypted by hand, and vice versa, obviously excluding AES messages, but a single party should not mix them.
